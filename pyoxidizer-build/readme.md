## Example
This example will build either an executable for linux (gnu) or and executable & msi-installer for windows (x32 or x64) and download it via the artifact-name.

#### Notes
- For linux: If the linux executable is build on ubuntu-22.04, the executable can't be used on lower ubuntu versions. Therefore, to be most compatible, you have to use ubuntu-20.04.
